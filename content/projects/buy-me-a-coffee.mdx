 ## Whats about?
This project was born cause I used to be a big supporter of creative people that used buy me a coffee platform.

And when I started learning programming thorugh projects I really wanted to understand how this was built.

So some days of hard work payed off and `Buy me a Coffee alw version` was born.

Ps if you want to support me use it haha jk. 

Ps Ps the app it's safe to use and it works it uses Stripe for the transactions. üòâ
