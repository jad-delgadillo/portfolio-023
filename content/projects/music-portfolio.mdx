 ## Whats about?
You kow this already got answered by the title. 

Yes, it is my music portfolio! üòú

Back in the day I used  to write and produce music for artsits and movie campaigns (I still do... sometimes), I even had some of my music on a Super Bowl Netflix commercial and another time for a National Geographic documentary.


Fun times, good memories. ‚ù§Ô∏è

So I made a website to showcase some of my work, hope you find some joy on it as I do.
